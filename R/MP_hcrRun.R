#' Wrapper for advice rule methods
#' 
#' ...
#' 
#' @param stk list of stocks
#' @param hcrpars (optional) Harvest Control Rule parameters for each stock. A named
#'                nested list. Each named list element corresponds to a stock
#'                and should contain a list of parameters for that stock.
#'                Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param hcrmethod named list of advice rule methods for each stock.
#'                  List elements may be the name of an in-built advice rule
#'                  method or a user-supplied function that is applied to the
#'                  stock. Defaults to 'hcrICES'.
#' @param ctrg (optional) named list of target catch for each stock.
#' @param ftrg (optional) named list of target fishing mortality for each stock
#' @param tracking a named list of tracking objects to monitor emergent dynamic
#'                 properties.
